## About Small Sample of [Pegasus](https://github.com/pxcs/pegasus_spyware_1.6/)
Pegasus represents a significant advancement in cyber surveillance technology, posing challenges for privacy and security globally. Its capabilities and the controversies surrounding its use highlight the complex interplay between technology, security, and human rights.
### Zero Click Attack & [Exploits](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-zero-click-malware)
The spyware can infect a device without any user interaction through "zero-click" exploits, which leverage vulnerabilities in software like messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage).

## Pegasus ID
>#### Spyware Identification Utilities - iOS & Android OS
>#### Version 1.6
>#### Date: 2024
## Overview
#### After extensive research and understanding of how `Pegasus` Spyware is operating inside of iOS and Android OS systems I have created tools that will be able to identify & validate the presence of the spyware on mobile devices, and tablets. Initial detection points were derived from the mvt projects.

#### These tools do not require your android device to be rooted and you do not have to take a full backup of your iOS device.

>**Background**: I am a professional mobile security engineer, and mobile forensic analyst. I work with human rights groups around the world teaching ethical mobile forensics practices, how to reverse engineer APTs, and how to engineer software and hardware tools to protect against data privacy violations among other things. 

>I Developed Mobile & IOT Device ID, Diagnostics, Data Clearing & Validation utilities for publicly traded companies around the world. I have worked with US government agencies, and privately held firms in this same regard. 

>For the past 8 years I was contracted to create mobile and IOT backdoors into software, firmware, and hardware.

## AndroidOS 
### You will be able to perform 
- Kernel Trace Analysis 
- Wake Lock Analysis 
- Power Monitor Analysis
 
> Currently I am teaching live phone `hacking` sessions and I will be updating this repository each week. 
> Phone Hacking Season.

### As of last year Method For Android OS is available

>  ### As I continue in the series we will get into 
> - iOS
> - WatchOS
> - iPadOS 
> - TizenOS
> - WebOS
> - FireOS
> - FlightOS
> - PebbleOS
> - More...

### What can this project do for me?
This project gives access to a number of technologies that have previously been "off limits" to developers. Due to being a private and undocumented API, MobileDevice. Pegasus has not been something that can be safely interacted with. This malware `attacks` provides access to:

1. Detecting attached iOS devices
2. Querying iOS devices for software and hardware configurations
3. Communication with device services
4. Sandbox access to applications installed on iOS devices
5. Installation of applications onto iOS devices
6. File transfers
 
## Data Analysis
